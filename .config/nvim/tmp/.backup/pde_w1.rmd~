# Types of Data

## Quantitative:
* Can be counted or measured and express as number certain quantity, amount, or range
* Can be either Discrete or Continous

### Discrete:
* Can be counted and has limited values

### Continous:
* Can be measured & have almost any value

## Qualitative:
* Can't be counted or measured, i.e. Names
* Can be Nominal or Oridnal

### Nominal:
* Can be categorized without set order

### Ordinal:
* Has a set order or scale

## Internal:
* Lives within a company's own systems
* Can be more reliable and easier to collect

## External:
* Lives and is generated outside an organization
* Valuable when needing most data possible structured

## Structured:
* Organized into a certain format, i.e. rows/columns
* **Ex**: spreadsheets or databases

## Unstructured:
* Not Organized in any easily identifiable manner


# Data Model:
* Model used for Organizing elements and how they relate

## Data Modeling:
* Process of creating diagrams that visually represent how data is organized/structured

### Levels of Data Modeling:
* Conceptual: high-level view of data structure
* Logical: focuses on technical details of databases: relationships, attributes, and entities 
* Physical: depicts how a database operates, defines all entities and attributes used

### Data-modeling techniques:
* Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visual way to understand relationship between entities in data model
* Unified Modeling Language (UML): are very detailed diagrams describing the structure of a system by 
								   showing the system's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationships

## Data Elements:
* Information such as names, account numbers, and addresses

### Data Types in Spreadsheets
* Number
* Text/string
* Boolean
* Rows in spreadsheets generalize to records in data tables
* Colums in spreadsheets generalize to fields in data tables, fields could also
  be data in cell


# Data Types
* Specific kind of data attribute that tells what kind of value data is

## Wide data
* every data subject has single row w/multi columns to hold values of various attribute

## Long data
* each row is ons time point per subject, i.e. each subject has multiple rows
