	Data Modeling:
		- Process of creating diagrams that visually represent

		Levels of Data Modeling:
			- Conceptual: high-level view of data structure
			- Logical:    focuses on technical details of databases:
						  relationships, attributes, and entities 
			- Physical:   depicts how a database operates,
						  defines all entities and attributes used
		Data-modeling techniques:
			- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):
				Visual way to understand relationship between entities
				in data model
			- Unified Modeling Language (UML):
				are very detailed diagrams describing the structure of a
				system by showing the system's entities, attributes, operations,
				and their relationships

Data Elements:
	- Information such as names, account numbers, and addresses
