# DotFiles

My Linux dotfiles.

I currently use Arch Linux.

Main programs: Hyprland, EWW, Alacritty, neovim, zsh, dash, uwsm, doas

I plan to switch to Ghostty when it is released.

zsh is my login shell

dash is my root shell

I am trying both fish and nushell as interactive shells

I link these files to their desired locations from a single git repo.

I provide the _setup_ script in this repo
change DOTS path at top of script to git repo location
run _setup_ script
**!!! READ SCRIPT FIRST !!!**
